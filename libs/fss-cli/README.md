# fsspec-cli

`fsspec-cli` is a library-only package for composing POSIX-shaped commands
over host-configured async fsspec filesystems.

Hosts embed its Typer application through the sole behavioral seam,
`App(sources).typer_app`. Each configured value is an
`AsyncFilesystemSource`: a callable that returns a fresh async context manager
for one command invocation.

The current command surface covers plain `ls`, source-free `basename string`,
mapped-file `cat`, and base `mkdir`. Commands share source-free argument
preflight and the synchronous Typer-to-asyncio boundary; `ls`, `cat`, and
`mkdir` also use invocation-owned source lifecycle. The `basename` slice is
exactly one argv token, no options, POSIX Issue 8 basename semantics, zero
source entry, and deterministic stdout with one trailing newline. Every valid
`ls` operand awaits `_info`; directories then await `_ls(path, detail=False)` and
strictly validate, filter, and locale-sort immediate child names. Mapped-file
`cat` awaits `_info`, requires fsspec `type == "file"`, stages each object
through `_get_file` into one secure temporary, and forwards exact binary chunks
to stdout with no text conversion. Stdin and `-` remain outside the first `cat`
profile. Base `mkdir` awaits `_mkdir(path, create_parents=False)` and
post-verifies `_info(path)` requires `type == "directory"`. Successful `mkdir`
invocations emit no stdout, continue after ordinary per-operand failure, and
disclose that passing rows claim only source-default creation semantics, not
POSIX mode or umask behavior. Rendering is deterministic, ordinary operand
failures continue with stable diagnostics, and output failures preserve their
accepted-byte boundary. Backend compatibility claims remain `unverified` until
their source-form gates run. The package has no console entry point or module
executable.

Package-owned hermetic probes now exercise adapted Local, adapted Memory, and
native async `vosfs` sources through that same public seam. They block name
resolution and high-level connection attempts, give `vosfs` a strict mocked
transport, and verify lifecycle, awaited calls, raw result shapes, output,
diagnostics, and exit behavior. The canonical row-scoped matrix records current
classifications and immutable evidence. Release-candidate readiness still
requires the isolated-wheel command-matrix gate. Native `vosfs` `cat` remains
`unverified` until the live OpenCADC gate supplements its hermetic evidence.
The live observation harness captures only classification, package, platform,
source-mode, call-shape, cleanup, commit, and immutable-run metadata; it never
publishes directory entries, file bytes, or credential material.
