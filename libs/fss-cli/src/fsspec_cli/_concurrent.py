"""Bounded, order-preserving concurrency for independent backend operations.

Remote backends pay one round trip per hook call, so commands that issue many
independent calls run them concurrently under one fixed bound. Results are
always returned in submission order, so output and the reported failure stay
deterministic regardless of completion order.

Per :doc:`lessons.md §3 <../../../vosfs/docs/design/fsspec-cli/lessons>`, a started
operation is never orphaned: after the first failure no new operation starts,
and every in-flight one is drained before control flow propagates.

    Operations start in submission order. Once one raises an ordinary

    holds one outcome per started operation and ``None`` for each operation

    before a stopping one has an outcome, so a caller scanning the result in
    order meets the first failure in submission order before any ``None``.

    an operation or delivered to the caller cancels the other started
    operations — each drains its in-flight hook call through
    ``_drain_current_operation`` — and propagates only after every started
    operation has finished.
