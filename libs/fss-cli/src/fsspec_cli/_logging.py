"""Standard-library transfer records for embedding hosts.

Commands log under the ``fsspec_cli`` logger hierarchy so a host can route
them through its own handlers; the library itself installs only a
``NullHandler`` and never prints a record. One INFO record describes each file
operation; DEBUG records describe content-identity decisions and staging.

Records never carry credentials: every logged path or operand passes through
:func:`_redact`, which drops URL user information, query strings, and
fragments, and escapes control characters. Storage options are never logged.
