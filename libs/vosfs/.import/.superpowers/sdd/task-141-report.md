Commit: `59c33dd feat(fsspec-cli): add same-source file mv (#141)`

Implemented exact awaitable `_mv` same-source file moves with target resolution,
same-path no-op, destination byte proof, source-absence proof, failure residue,
cancellation, docs, matrix, and isolated-wheel coverage.

Historical pre-fix checkpoint: `uv run --package fsspec-cli pytest src/fsspec-cli/tests` — 779 passed,
8 skipped; isolated-wheel gate passed (588 core, 13 vosfs tests).

Self-review: no actionable defects found. Native `vosfs` and adapted source
matrix rows remain `unverified` until qualifying exact `_mv` evidence exists.

## Fix pass

Historical fix-pass checkpoint results below precede later spec and standards fixes.

Changes:

- Require `_mv` to be an awaitable operation declared directly by the configured
  source form; inherited defaults and public synchronous `mv` are rejected
  before staging.
- Add move coverage for target resolution/no-op spelling, missing parents,
  failure residue, destination type/size/content verification, retained source,
  cleanup, configured-name identity, adapted Local/Memory rejection, and native
  `vosfs` unverified classification.
- Record exact-operation rejection evidence in the move profile and command
  matrix.

Commands and output:

- `uv run --package fsspec-cli pytest src/fsspec-cli/tests/test_mv.py -q` — `18 passed`
- `uv run --package fsspec-cli pytest src/fsspec-cli/tests/test_command_matrix.py src/fsspec-cli/tests/test_vosfs_command_matrix.py -q` — `45 passed`
- `uv run --package fsspec-cli pytest src/fsspec-cli/tests` — `790 passed, 8 skipped`
- `uv run --no-project python src/fsspec-cli/tests/_installed_wheel_gate.py` — core `598 passed, 3 skipped`; vosfs `14 passed, 1 skipped`

Standards fix: reverted hand-edited fsspec-cli changelog to origin/main; changelog diff now empty.

## Spec coverage fix

Authoritative final validation: repository CI passed Quality, Ubuntu/macOS tests, both
Ubuntu/macOS wheel gates, and Required; live integration remained skipped.

Added direct existing-file replacement, `-i`/`--interactive` source-free
rejection, cancellation temporary/source-close, and separate source-deletion
failure versus retained-source coverage. Directory-source profile now records
runtime status `1` after `_info`; full fsspec-cli suite: 793 passed, 8 skipped.
