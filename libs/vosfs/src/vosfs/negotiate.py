"""Synchronous byte-transfer negotiation helpers (contract section 7).

These pure helpers support the filesystem's negotiation flow: build an
authority-qualified transfer target, parse the transfer-details document into
its negotiated protocols, validate a redirect target, and choose the protocol
whose security method is compatible with the configured credential. Credential
routing follows the negotiated security method, not origin alone.
