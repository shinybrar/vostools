"""Client-derived recursive removal over the OpenCADC VOSpace profile.

The service exposes no recursive ``DELETE`` this client is willing to rely on,
so a tree is removed leaves-first from the client. Independent work runs
concurrently: sibling subtrees are listed and emptied in parallel and the
entries of one container are deleted together, but a container is deleted only
after every one of its children is confirmed gone. Removal is **non-atomic**:
after a failure no new request starts, in-flight deletions finish, and the
error reports every confirmed deletion rather than pretending the tree is gone
or that nothing was touched.
