"""Disk-backed staging files for whole-object reads and writes.

OpenCADC Cavern does not implement HTTP byte ranges, so a seekable read is a
whole-object download into a disk-backed temporary file, and a staged write
buffers into a temporary file that is uploaded once on a successful close.

Both views subclass the standard buffered IO wrappers so they inherit the full
file-object protocol (``read``/``readinto``/``readline``/iteration/``seek``/
``tell`` and, for writes, ``write``) and only add temporary-file cleanup and the
upload-on-clean-close commit behaviour.
