"""fsspec reusable abstract suites wired against vosfs (TRD section 15.1 item 5).

Each abstract suite from :mod:`fsspec.tests.abstract` is subclassed against a
simulator-backed synchronous :class:`~vosfs.VOSpaceFileSystem`. A single
:class:`VOSpaceFixtures` mixin supplies the ``fs``/``fs_join``/``fs_path``
fixtures; the inherited scenario fixtures build their trees through that same
filesystem, so state persists in the in-memory simulator.

The pinned fsspec 2026.6.0 suites collect 137 cases: 131 supported cases run and
six question-mark glob cases are skipped as one explicit Unsupported capability.
The six skips are the ``fil?1`` non-recursive and recursive rows in copy, get,
and put. The current path grammar treats ``?`` as a URL query delimiter, so it
cannot express those glob paths without widening the public path contract.

List-source get, including the hashed-name fixture, runs as supported evidence;
its former failure was fixture teardown, not a backend capability gap. All
missing-parent put cases also run after coordinated writes gained top-down
parent materialization.
