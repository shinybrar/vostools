# `fsspec-cli` trailing-byte command profile

<!-- pyml disable line-length -->

Status: **Locked command semantics and async execution contract**

Question: [Add the `tail` command](https://github.com/shinybrar/vosfs/issues/198)

Client baseline: **fsspec 2026.6.0**

This profile admits the shell-experience specification's backend-neutral
trailing-byte read over fsspec's native async `_info` and `_cat_file` hooks. It
does not claim POSIX or GNU `tail(1)` compatibility.

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**,
and **MAY** are interpreted as described by
[RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) and
[RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174) only when capitalized.

## 1. Scope and command form

The supported form is:

```text
tail -c N [--] name:/path
```

Exactly one byte-count selector and one mapped filesystem operand are REQUIRED.
Only the separate-token `-c N` selector is supported. The selector MAY appear
before or after the operand while option parsing is active. `--` ends option
parsing.

`N` MUST contain one or more ASCII decimal digits. It is non-negative and MAY
contain leading zeros. Signs, suffixes, whitespace, fractions, empty values,
non-ASCII digits, and values rejected by Python's configured integer-conversion
safety ceiling are invalid. Inline or grouped selectors, repeated selectors,
`-n`, default counts, stdin, multiple operands, and every other option are
unsupported.

Exact `--help` remains the framework-owned help spelling. The mapped-operand
grammar and validation order are those of the shared command toolkit. The
command adds these stable preflight diagnostics:

| Condition | Diagnostic |
| --- | --- |
| Missing or repeated selector | `tail: exactly one byte-count selector is required` |
| Selector without a following token | `tail: -c: option requires an argument` |
| Invalid count | `tail: <value>: invalid byte count` |
| Zero operands after a valid selector | `tail: missing mapped filesystem operand` |
| More than one operand | `tail: extra operand` |

Every preflight failure completes with status `2`, empty stdout, exactly one
stable diagnostic, and no source factory or filesystem call.

## 2. Backend operation contract

After complete preflight, acquire the operand's mapped source once. Await
exactly these two calls in order:

```python
info = await filesystem._info(path)
await filesystem._cat_file(path, start=info["size"] - N, end=None)
```

The metadata result MUST be a mapping whose `size` value has exact type `int`
and is non-negative. Booleans, floats, strings, missing sizes, negative sizes,
and non-mappings are incompatible and prevent the read call.

The suffix start is passed through even when negative; negative starts are
fsspec's native from-end spelling. `N == 0` passes `start=size`. The CLI never
passes both `start=None` and `end=None`, and therefore never requests an
unbounded or whole-object hook call.

The CLI MUST NOT make another metadata or read call. It MUST NOT use
`_get_file`, `open`, another filesystem hook, a synchronous facade, or a retry.
It MUST NOT stage the result, branch on backend type, consult a capability
registry, or clamp a negative start.

## 3. Accepted result and output

The byte result MUST have exact type `bytes` and its length MUST NOT exceed
`N`. Byte arrays, memory views, text, other values, and overlong byte results
are incompatible. Both backend results are validated before stdout is touched.

Compatible bytes are written unchanged to binary stdout. The command adds no
newline, encoding, decoding, or text conversion. An empty result writes
nothing. A short write or flush failure is an output failure.

An incompatible metadata or byte result produces status `1`, empty stdout,
and:

```text
tail: <operand>: incompatible result
```

## 4. Failure and lifecycle behavior

Backend exceptions use the shared stable per-operand diagnostics. Ordinary
backend, incompatible-result, output, source-entry, and source-exit failures
produce status `1`. A sole `BrokenPipeError` is silent and produces status
`141`, matching mapped-file `cat`; a source-exit failure still takes precedence
and produces status `1`. Other output failures use the shared
`tail: output: output failure ...` diagnostic. No bytes are emitted after a
metadata, read, or result-validation failure.

Source ownership, same-loop acquisition and cleanup, exception information,
control-flow propagation, and failure precedence follow
[ADR 0002](../adr/0002-own-async-filesystems-per-invocation.md) and
[ADR 0003](../adr/0003-acquire-referenced-async-filesystem-sources.md).

## 5. Physical-transfer caveat

The bounded suffix `_cat_file` call shape constrains what the CLI asks of a
backend; it does not guarantee a ranged physical transfer. A backend may
implement the hook by downloading a whole object and slicing locally. In
particular, the [`vosfs` read contract](trd.md#8-read-contract) states that
OpenCADC Cavern lacks HTTP Range support: `VOSpaceFileSystem._cat_file`
performs one negotiated whole-object GET, sends no `Range` header, and applies
the requested suffix slice locally. This profile does not claim remote Range
or network-efficient random access.

## 6. Evidence

Hermetic binary-output and call-shape tests MUST exercise the public
`App(sources).typer_app` seam across:

- adapted async Local;
- adapted async Memory; and
- native async `vosfs` with a mocked transport and no network access.

Focused tests additionally lock strict count parsing, option ordering, exact
`--help`, the `--` terminator, source-free preflight, exact metadata and suffix
call shapes, negative suffix starts, exact bytes, strict result validation,
backend diagnostics, short writes, flush failures, broken pipes, and
invocation-owned cleanup. Native `vosfs` evidence MUST observe its truthful
whole-object GET without a `Range` header while separately asserting that the
CLI's `_cat_file` request is bounded.

This ticket records its matrix rows as `unverified` until immutable qualifying
evidence exists. Evidence remains limited to the named source forms.
