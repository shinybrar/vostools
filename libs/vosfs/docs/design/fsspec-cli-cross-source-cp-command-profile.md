# `fsspec-cli` verified cross-source two-operand `cp` command profile

Status: **Locked command semantics and async execution contract**

Question: [Add verified cross-source two-operand copy](https://github.com/shinybrar/vosfs/issues/138)
Parent: [Issue #120](https://github.com/shinybrar/vosfs/issues/120)

## Scope

```text
cp [--] source_a:/file source_b:/target
```

Distinct configured source names select this profile. Backend class, object
identity, and protocol do not select behavior. Recursive copy, move,
multi-source copy, retries, metadata preservation, and implicit local operands
remain outside scope.

## Execution

Command validates both mapped operands before source entry. It then acquires
source and destination once, in operand order, before backend I/O or output.

Source `_info` must report `type == "file"` and non-negative integer `size`.
Destination resolution, existing-parent requirement, replacement rules, and
diagnostics match [verified same-source `cp`](fsspec-cli-same-source-cp-command-profile.md).

Command creates one secure local source staging temporary, downloads source
through `_get_file`, closes it, uploads through destination `_put_file(...,
mode="overwrite")`, then requires destination `_info` file type and original
source size. It verifies destination by bounded streaming comparison against
that same source temporary: destination bytes flow through a secure FIFO (or
backend open stream when FIFO is unsupported), so no second full destination
disk temporary exists. FIFO/pipe and source temporary cleanup runs after
success, verification failure, and unlink faults; cleanup errors remain
failures. If both configured names yield the same filesystem object and
resolved path, it rejects `same path` before staging or upload. Staging errors
disclose only error class, never local temporary paths or source content.

Successful status `0` proves source retention, destination type, byte count,
and content. Failed upload or later verification reports destination residue
may remain. Command never deletes destination to simulate rollback and never
claims atomicity.

## Evidence

Hermetic Local-to-Memory and Memory-to-Local positive gates pass through the
public `App` seam. The installed-wheel gate runs those matrix tests from a
built `fsspec-cli` wheel. Native `vosfs` directions remain `unverified` until
independently qualified.
