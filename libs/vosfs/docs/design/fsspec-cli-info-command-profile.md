# `fsspec-cli` normalized `info` command profile

<!-- pyml disable line-length -->

Status: **Locked backend-neutral command profile (production command shipped by #200)**

Question: [Implement `info` and reconcile it with `stat`](https://github.com/shinybrar/vosfs/issues/200)

Parent: [Shell-compatible experience epic](https://github.com/shinybrar/vosfs/issues/204)

Normative direction: [shell-experience specification](fsspec-cli-shell-experience-spec.md), especially sections 2, 4, 7, and 8

Related, behaviorally unchanged command: [reduced BSD/macOS-shaped `stat`](fsspec-cli-bsd-macos-stat-command-profile.md)

## 1. Boundary with `stat`

`info` is the backend-neutral, raw **normalized-dictionary** view of one fsspec
metadata mapping. It displays every `ListingRow` field and preserves
backend-specific values under `extra`. Sparse metadata is successful and is
shown honestly as `None`; no backend branch fills a gap.

Existing `stat` remains the reduced BSD/macOS-shaped, Local-rich view of one or
more operands. It requires its complete locked metadata shape, resolves local
owner/group presentation, and emits its fixed host-shaped line. This profile
does not alter `stat` argv, validation, rendering, continuation, or evidence.

Neither command is POSIX, GNU, full BSD/macOS, nor an all-fsspec compatibility
claim. `info` is not a backend-specific extension: backend keys are data, not a
dispatch mechanism.

## 2. Invocation and source-free preflight

Accepted argv is exactly:

```text
info [--] name:/path
```

- Exactly one mapped operand is REQUIRED.
- No command options are accepted. `--` ends option parsing.
- Framework-owned `--help` before `--` remains Typer's help short circuit.
- Preflight completes before any source factory, entry, or filesystem work.

Diagnostics and status are:

| Condition | Diagnostic | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing operand | `info: missing mapped filesystem operand` | `2` |
| Unsupported option | `info: <token>: unsupported option` | `2` |
| Extra operand | `info: extra operand` | `2` |
| Malformed mapped operand | `info: <operand>: invalid mapped filesystem operand` | `2` |
| Unknown mapped name | `info: <operand>: unknown filesystem (known: <names>)` | `2` |

Inserted values use the shared diagnostic escaping algorithm. Pure preflight
failure has empty stdout and touches no source.

## 3. Operation and normalization

After successful preflight, the command:

1. acquires the one referenced source exactly once under ADR 0002/0003;
2. awaits exactly one `filesystem._info(path)` call;
3. requires the result to be a `Mapping` whose keys are exact `str` objects;
4. passes that same mapping once to the existing pure `to_listing` adapter; and
5. renders the resulting `ListingRow` without another metadata adapter.

It MUST NOT call `_ls`, retry `_info`, use a public synchronous facade, consult
another metadata primitive, or branch on backend type. A non-mapping,
non-string key, adapter rejection, or value that cannot be rendered into the
locked payload is an `incompatible result`.

Normalization semantics, including basename selection, kind mapping, optional
field validation, timestamp coercion, and the exact division between normalized
keys and `extra`, remain owned by the shell specification's single
`to_listing` layer. The command MUST NOT fabricate a missing value.

## 4. Exact output

The command creates this plain Python dictionary from the normalized row:

```python
{
    "name": row.name,
    "kind": row.kind,
    "size": row.size,
    "mtime": row.mtime,
    "mode": row.mode,
    "nlink": row.nlink,
    "owner": row.owner,
    "group": row.group,
    "link_target": row.link_target,
    "extra": dict(row.extra),
}
```

Before rendering, the command traverses every `Mapping`, list, tuple, set, and
frozenset, including subclasses, across both mapping keys and values. Mappings
are copied to plain Python dictionaries, list/tuple subclasses retain their
base container shape, and every original entry/value is retained. Set and
frozenset elements are recursively rendered, sorted by those rendered strings,
and presented with their native `{...}` / `set()` / `frozenset({...})`
spelling.

Mapping traversal snapshots `len(mapping)`, enumerates keys through the core
`for key in mapping` interface, and retrieves each value through
`mapping[key]`. It does not consult an overridden `items()` view. The number of
enumerated entries and the final canonical dictionary size must both equal the
snapshot; any disagreement makes the whole result incompatible.

A mapping key must canonicalize to a hashable presentation. Its exact
`pprint.pformat(..., width=80, sort_dicts=True)` spelling must also be unique
within that mapping. If two distinct source keys produce one spelling, or the
canonical dictionary has fewer entries than the source mapping, the whole
result is incompatible; the renderer never silently collapses an entry.
Structured tuple/frozenset keys therefore remain stable across Python hash
seeds without being converted to strings. After uniqueness validation, the
final dictionary key is a stable hashable presentation containing that frozen
spelling and a stable source-type sort key. Final pretty-printing therefore
cannot invoke the original key's `repr` again or change its validated spelling.

An identity is recursive only while it is active on the current traversal
stack. A cycle through a mapping key or value, including an indirect cycle
through a recognized container subclass, is incompatible. Reusing one acyclic
container in multiple sibling positions is valid and renders it at each
position. This presentation-only canonicalization prevents a read-only
mapping's opaque `repr` and hash-randomized set iteration from bypassing nested
sorting; it does not reinterpret metadata.

The command then renders with
`pprint.pformat(value, width=80, sort_dicts=True)`, appends exactly one newline,
and encodes it as UTF-8. Dictionary keys use the stdlib pretty-printer's
ordering; set/frozenset members use the canonical rendered-string ordering
above. Other values retain their stdlib Python presentation; for example bytes
stay bytes, datetimes stay datetimes, and tuples stay tuples. Nothing is
coerced through a JSON type system. A scalar object's successful custom `repr`
is its truthful value presentation and is outside a cross-process stability
claim supplied by this command.

An ordinary exception raised while hashing/canonicalizing a key or producing a
value's `repr` makes the result incompatible before stdout. An escaping
`BaseException` from either stage is control flow: it reaches source exit and
the direct caller as the exact original object after same-task cleanup.

All nine normalized scalar fields are present even when their value is `None`.
`extra` is always present and contains every backend-specific string key/value
preserved by `to_listing`. No field is relabeled, dropped because it is sparse,
or replaced by a placeholder.

The complete payload is assembled before output. A successful command performs
one binary stdout `write(payload)` followed by one `flush()`. A short write is
an output failure; the command never retries or writes a partial remainder.

## 5. Failure, cleanup, and status

| Outcome | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Backend `FileNotFoundError` / ordinary error | Shared stable operand diagnostic; status `1` |
| Incompatible result, including ordinary render failure | `info: <operand>: incompatible result`; status `1` |
| Short write / ordinary output error | Shared output diagnostic; status `1` |
| `BrokenPipeError` | No output-failure diagnostic; status `1` |
| Source cleanup error | Shared ADR 0003 diagnostic; status `1` |
| Escaping `BaseException` | Same-task cleanup, then original object propagates unchanged |
| Success | Status `0` |

The `_info` mapping and rendered payload are complete before stdout begins, so
there is no field-by-field output. Source cleanup always follows ADR 0003;
truthy exits cannot suppress command outcomes.

## 6. Evidence and claim boundary

Hermetic public-`App` evidence covers:

- adapted async Memory with sparse metadata and a `datetime` extra;
- adapted async Local with rich mode/identity metadata and Local-only extras;
- native async `vosfs` over a strict mocked HTTP transport, including `uri`,
  `md5`, `content_type`, and VOSpace `properties` extras; and
- source-free argv rejection, exact hook count, incompatible results, atomic
  output, broken pipe, cleanup, and control-flow precedence;
- subprocess rendering under distinct `PYTHONHASHSEED` values, including set
  values and structured frozenset/tuple mapping keys; and
- mapping-key collisions, key/value cycles, subclass cycles, shared acyclic
  containers, an overridden incomplete `items()` view, one-time key spelling,
  and ordinary/control-flow `repr` failures.

These tests establish only the named source forms and the locked command seam.
They are not a completeness claim for arbitrary fsspec backends or evidence
that every backend value has a stable custom `repr`.

## 7. Help and README language

Help:

```text
Usage: info [--] name:/path
Display normalized file information
```

README wording keeps the boundary visible: `info` is one normalized raw mapping
with backend extras; `stat` remains the stricter reduced BSD/macOS-shaped view.
