# `fsspec-cli` positively evidenced same-source file `mv` profile

Status: **Locked command semantics and async execution contract**

Part of [#120](https://github.com/shinybrar/vosfs/issues/120) / [#141](https://github.com/shinybrar/vosfs/issues/141)

## Scope

```text
mv [--] name:/file name:/target
```

Exactly two mapped operands, same configured source name, no options. File
source only. Cross-source, `-i`, `-f`, and every other option or unprofiled
operand shape reject before source entry with status `2`. Multiple same-source
file operands into an existing directory are covered by the
[multi-file same-source `mv` profile](fsspec-cli-same-source-multi-file-mv-command-profile.md).
A directory source enters its source, then `_info` reports `is a directory`
with status `1`.

Target resolution matches verified same-source `cp`: destination directory gets
source basename, existing files may replace, and resolved parent must exist as a
directory.

## Directory admission boundary

Directory `mv` is unsupported. Its rejection cannot be source-free because
the command must await source `_info` to distinguish a directory from a file.
After `type == "directory"`, it emits `mv: <source>: is a directory`, exits
`1`, and MUST NOT resolve the target, stage bytes, or call `_mv`.

No current exact source form admits directory movement: adapted async Local and
Memory, and native async `vosfs`, declare no awaitable `_mv`. Reusing a
synthetic file-only `_mv`, synchronous facade, tree walk, copy/delete sequence,
or inherited default would not prove a source directory operation.

Thus no positive claim exists for destination hierarchy or replacement,
destination-inside-source containment, links or special/malformed descendants,
partial failure/residue, or cancellation at a directory mutation boundary.
The rejection test proves only source inspection, deterministic diagnostic, no
staging, and no mutation. All directory-move source forms remain `unverified`;
future admission needs one exact source form with a direct awaitable operation
and full evidence for every listed boundary.

Evidence: hermetic public-seam rejection test at
[`e9c9fa98bfc521628092fa7532d8ac8098d36734`](https://github.com/shinybrar/vosfs/commit/e9c9fa98bfc521628092fa7532d8ac8098d36734).
Pinned stack: `fsspec-cli` 0.1.1, fsspec 2026.6.0, Typer 0.27.0, and vosfs
0.4.0 on macOS with CPython 3.13.5. On that stack, a source-form declaration
probe found no direct `_mv` in adapted async Local or Memory or native async
`vosfs`.

## Operation and proof

After source existence and target resolution, identical configured name and
backend path is status `0` no-op. It calls no move operation and emits nothing.

Every other path requires an awaitable `_mv(path1, path2)` declared directly
by configured source form. Public synchronous `mv`, copy-then-delete,
cross-source staging, and inherited or non-awaitable move defaults are
excluded.

Before mutation, command stages source bytes. After `_mv`, success requires:

1. destination is `type == "file"` with original size;
2. destination staged bytes match original staged bytes; and
3. source `_info` raises `FileNotFoundError`.

Any move exception, wrong destination result, destination mismatch, source
residue, or verification failure exits `1` with residue disclosure. Cancellation
and other control flow propagate after source cleanup. Successful invocations
emit no stdout.

Passing result proves target resolution, replacement, destination completeness,
source absence, diagnostics, cleanup, and partial-state reporting only. It does
not prove atomic rename, identity preservation, POSIX mode, ownership, links,
timestamps, or generic metadata preservation.

## Evidence

Matrix rows classify adapted async Local, adapted async Memory, and native async
`vosfs` independently. A source form lacking exact awaitable `_mv` remains
`unverified`; no backend behavior is inferred from operation names or inherited
sync facades. Isolated-wheel gate runs `test_mv.py`.
