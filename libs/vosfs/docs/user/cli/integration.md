# Integrating fsspec-cli

This page covers what you need to embed `fsspec-cli` correctly: the seam, the
source contract, lifecycle ownership, capability policy, extensions, and the
exit statuses your callers will see.

## The seam

There is exactly one stable entry point:

```python
App(sources, *, capabilities=None, extensions=()).typer_app
```

It returns a `typer.Typer` you mount wherever you want:

```python
app = typer.Typer()
app.add_typer(App(sources).typer_app, name="fs")
```

## Sources

A source is a **callable returning a fresh async context manager** that yields
one `AbstractFileSystem` per command invocation.

```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

@asynccontextmanager
async def archive_source():
    fs = VOSpaceFileSystem(
        endpoint_url="https://staging.canfar.net/arc",
        asynchronous=True,
        skip_instance_cache=True,
    )
    try:
        yield fs
    finally:
        await fs.aclose()
```

!!! warning "A fresh filesystem per invocation, not a shared one"

    The callable is invoked **per command run**, and the library owns the
    yielded filesystem for exactly that run. Do not close over one long-lived
    instance: `fsspec-cli` acquires and releases on the invocation's own event
    loop, and a filesystem bound to a different loop will fail.

    This is also why `skip_instance_cache=True` matters — without it fsspec may
    hand back a cached instance owned by another loop.

Source names must be non-empty strings with no colon, NUL, or newline, and must
not start with `-`. `App` validates this at construction, so a bad name is a
startup error, not a runtime surprise.

### Lifecycle guarantees

- Every source referenced by the operand list is acquired **before** any
  filesystem work, once each, in first-appearance order.
- Sources are released in reverse order. Every exit runs even if an earlier one
  raises.
- Acquisition, command body, and release all happen on the same event loop.
- A source-exit failure produces a nonzero status **even if the command body
  succeeded** — a cleanup failure is a real failure.

!!! danger "Do not call from inside a running event loop"

    The commands are synchronous Typer callbacks that own `asyncio.run`. Called
    from an already-running loop they exit `1` with
    `<command>: cannot run from an active event loop`.

## Capabilities

Recursive operations are explicit constructor policy:

```python
guarded = App(
    {"data": data_source},
    capabilities={"recursion": {"copy": True, "remove": True}},
)
```

| Capability | Default | When disabled |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `recursion.copy` | `True` | `cp` omits `-R`/`-r` from its signature entirely |
| `recursion.remove` | `False` | `rm` omits `-R`/`-r` from its signature entirely |

Because the *callback signature* changes, Typer rejects a disabled option with
status `2` before any operand or source work, and `--help` never mentions it.
The command never infers this from a backend type or protocol.

!!! danger "`recursion.remove` is your assertion, not a default"

    Enabling recursive removal asserts that every configured target satisfies
    the guarded-removal contract. Removal is **sequential and non-atomic**: a
    failure or cancellation can leave earlier confirmed removals in place and
    the rest present or uncertain. There is no prompt, rollback, retry, trash,
    or recovery.

## Extensions

Extensions are ordinary annotated callbacks. Their name, docstring, and
annotations define the command through Typer:

```python
import typer
from fsspec_cli import CommandCallback, CommandContext


def about() -> None:
    """Describe this host."""
    typer.echo("Example filesystem host")


def source_names(ctx: typer.Context) -> None:
    """List configured source names."""
    context = ctx.find_object(CommandContext)
    assert context is not None
    typer.echo("\n".join(context.sources))


extensions: list[CommandCallback] = [about, source_names]
app = App({"data": data_source}, extensions=extensions)
```

Source-free callbacks need no context parameter. Source-aware callbacks read
the frozen snapshot from `CommandContext`, which exposes **only** the source
mapping — never capability policy or private helpers.

The bundled `sign` extension shows the intended shape for a backend-specific
command:

```python
from fsspec_cli.extensions import sign

App({"data": data_source}, extensions=[sign])
```

`sign data:/path` calls the selected filesystem's `sign` capability. A source
without it exits nonzero with one `unsupported operation` diagnostic and no
traceback — support is detected by calling, never inferred from backend type.

## Exit statuses

Anything shelling out to your CLI needs these:

| Status | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| `0` | Every operand completed and cleanup succeeded. |
| `1` | A backend, incompatible-result, output, or source-lifecycle failure. |
| `2` | Usage or operand preflight failed; **no filesystem work ran**. |
| `141` | `128 + SIGPIPE` — a broken pipe was the only failure. |

Status `2` is a useful guarantee for destructive commands: if you get `2`,
nothing was touched.

!!! warning "`test` uses `1` as an answer, not an error"

    A false `test -e|-d|-f` predicate exits `1` with empty output. That is the
    normal negative answer, not a failure. A real failure also writes a
    diagnostic to stderr — check stderr, not just the status.

### Which commands can exit `141`

Only the streaming commands, where a closed reader is worth distinguishing from
a real failure:

```bash
myapp fs cat data:/huge.log | head -5   # 141
```

| Broken pipe gives | Commands |
| --- | --- |
| `141` | `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `rm -v` |
| `1` | `ls`, `ll`, `du`, `find`, `tree`, `info`, `size`, `stat`, `sign` |

The second group formats and buffers its whole output before a single write, so
a broken pipe there is an ordinary output failure with nothing partially
emitted. If you are checking for `141`, check for `1` as well unless you know
which command ran.

## Diagnostics

Failures go to stderr as one line per operand:

```text
<command>: <operand>: <category>
```

Stable categories: `not found`, `file exists`, `permission denied`,
`is a directory`, `not a directory`, `unsupported operation`,
`incompatible result`, `backend failure (<Class>): <message>`, and
`uncertain …` variants.

!!! note "`uncertain` is a third outcome"

    A category beginning `uncertain` means a mutation was **dispatched** but its
    result could not be observed. The operation may have applied. Do not treat
    it as a plain failure and blindly retry — a retry can double-apply.

Control characters in an operand are escaped as `\xNN` before rendering, so a
hostile or malformed path cannot inject terminal escapes.

## Shell completion

`App.typer_app` is built with `add_completion=False`, because a mounted
sub-app is the wrong place to install completion. Enable it on **your** root
app instead:

```python
app = typer.Typer(add_completion=True)
app.add_typer(App(sources).typer_app, name="fs")
```
