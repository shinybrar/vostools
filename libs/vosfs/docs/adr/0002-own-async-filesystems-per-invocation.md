# Own async filesystems per command invocation

Status: Accepted

Typer invokes command callbacks synchronously, while `fsspec-cli` command work
is async-only and native `vosfs` resources require awaited cleanup on their
owning event loop. `fsspec-cli` therefore accepts a non-empty
`Mapping[str, AsyncFilesystemSource]` instead of live filesystem instances.
Each source is a reusable synchronous callable returning a fresh async context
manager that yields one `AbstractFileSystem` for a command invocation.

The host owns each source's backend configuration and cleanup declaration.
`App` owns the yielded filesystem only for that invocation: one command
coroutine enters every required source, validates and uses each yielded
filesystem, and exits every entered source on the same event loop before that
loop closes. A yielded filesystem never escapes the invocation or crosses into
a later invocation. The source context exit is the generic cleanup interface;
`App` does not discover or call a backend-specific cleanup method.

The sole stable v1 seam remains `App(sources).typer_app`. Each concrete Typer
command uses one zero-command-logic synchronous adapter to check for an active
same-thread event loop and, when none exists, run one command coroutine. Direct
invocation from an active same-thread loop produces a stable configuration
diagnostic. V1 exposes no public async invocation seam, background loop, hidden
runner thread, or nested-loop workaround.

After source entry and before filesystem I/O, `App` accepts only an
`AsyncFileSystem` with `async_impl is True` and `asynchronous is True`. Raw
synchronous and wrong-mode instances are rejected. A host source may explicitly
yield `AsyncFileSystemWrapper(raw, asynchronous=True)`, recorded as
`adapted async`; `fsspec-cli` never creates that wrapper or branches on its
class. Production command code awaits fsspec's version-tested, documented
underscore coroutines such as `_info` and `_ls`; it never calls their public
synchronous facades.

A native VOS source constructs a fresh
`VOSpaceFileSystem(asynchronous=True, skip_instance_cache=True)` inside the
invocation loop and awaits `aclose()` from its context-manager exit before that
loop closes. `fsspec-cli` imports no `vosfs` runtime dependency and owns no VOS
configuration or authentication behavior.

This decision supersedes only the live-instance injection and ownership clauses
in [Release fsspec-cli independently inside the vosfs workspace](./0001-release-fsspec-cli-independently.md).
The independent workspace, release, tag, artifact, dependency, publication,
and sole Typer-seam decisions remain accepted.

## Considered alternatives

- Borrowed live instances require every ordinary Typer host to own a persistent
  runner from filesystem creation through cleanup, making the common embedding
  path unsafe by default.
- Borrowed and managed catalogs plus pluggable runners are coherent but expose
  speculative v1 seams.
- A background fsspec sync bridge, nested event loop, or hidden runner thread
  violates the async-only direction and obscures resource ownership.

## Consequences

- Hosts trade cross-invocation filesystem reuse for deterministic same-loop
  creation, use, and cleanup.
- Source lifecycle failure ordering, diagnostics, and exit precedence belong to
  [issue #94](https://github.com/shinybrar/vosfs/issues/94) before production
  sequencing.
- Exact backend compatibility remains command-, backend-, and version-tested;
  no generic fsspec compatibility claim follows from this lifecycle contract.
